# exSIDBlaster 
__Original exSID Project by Thibaut Varène.__ http://hacks.slashdirt.org/hw/exsid/

Patched firmware to always use "chip 1", no matter what setting is used in the SID player. We only have one chip, right? ;)
I got annoyed having to enable "Fake Stereo" among other things. And the support for it seemed a bit flakey. (I couldn't get it to work on all players.)

Also changed the boot jingle to a tune you may know... for the heck of it!
